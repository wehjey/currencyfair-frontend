# CurrencyFair FrontEnd

Hosted on Firebase - [Project UI URL HERE](https://currencyfair.web.app)

Project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS and VS Code.

Continuous integration was implemented using Travis CI and project was deployed on Firebase Hosting

### Steps Taken

The provided mock up was first converted into a pure HTML file before being implemented into React JS. 

The HTML was broken down into different components in React to increase readability and ensure resuability of components

Each component is located in its own folder for e.g Header component has a header folder with files such as index.js, Header.js Header.test.js and Header.css. This is done to ensure better code maintainability and cleaner directory structure.

Tests were written for components to ensure required elements are always shown

### Problems Encountered

I had some issues ensuring that elements are properly displayed on all viewports but I was able to eventually achieve this.
